ScriptTagFinder is a Python program/tool that was written for a university-level course project (CYB333 Security Automation). Additionally, this GitHub Repository was created as part of the course project's criteria. 

ScriptTagFinder searches any website for <script> tags within the website's HTML content. A website's URL must be entered/inputted at the program's prompt. The results of the executed code will reveal whether or not that website has <script> tags. The executed code also accounts for error checking for invalid URL formats or status code errors for incomplete/unfulfilled web server requests.
